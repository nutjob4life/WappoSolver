Wappo Solver
============

So, around 2006-11-17 I must've been into this puzzle game called "Wappo" that
was probably on my old `Nokia 6620`_ phone.  There are some screen shots for it
at `Softex Digital`_ but that must be an updated version as I don't recall the
game ever looking that sophisticated.

And I must've been stuck on some level, so I wrote this comment-free code to
solve it.  I don't think it ever worked right, though.

The joystick on that phone eventually died, making the game (and most phone
features) unusable.
